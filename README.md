# Pipeline: Noise Prediction Model for NASA Airfoil Dataset

> Description:
This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline to predict noise levels generated by airfoils, using Spark and a dataset provided by NASA. The pipeline was developed with data engineering tasks such as data cleaning and feature preparation, followed by the application of a linear regression model.

## Key Components:

* Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Loaded raw data and performed preprocessing steps including duplicate removal, handling missing values, and renaming columns for clarity.
Saved the cleaned dataset in Parquet format for optimized storage and access.

* Feature Engineering:
Created a feature vector using Spark's VectorAssembler to consolidate relevant features into a single vector.
Scaled the features using StandardScaler to normalize the data, improving the modelâ€™s performance.

* Modeling and Evaluation:
Built a linear regression model to predict noise levels (in decibels) based on aerodynamic features such as frequency, angle of attack, and chord length.
Evaluated model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared metrics.
Achieved an R-squared value of approximately 0.54, indicating moderate predictive capability.

* Pipeline Deployment:
Integrated the stages into a Spark ML pipeline for streamlined processing and model reproducibility.
Saved and reloaded the trained pipeline model to demonstrate persistence and model reuse.

## Technologies Used:
PySpark (DataFrames, MLlib), Jupyter Notebook, NASA Airfoil Self-Noise Dataset
